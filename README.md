## SLS-for-Integrated Sensing and Communication
System Level Simulator for NR-based Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Network.
Focuses on the Physical (PHY) layer only.

## Members paticipated in this project:
D.S. Xue, J.C. Wei, Y.G. Li, T.L. Zeng, 
Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education,
Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,
Beijing, PR China.


## MATLAB version and toolboxes required: 
MATLAB R2022b or above,
5G Toolbox, Phased Array Toolbox, Wireless Communication Toolbox.


## Main Features
Interface with the Vienna 5G system-level simulator (closed-source),
Scenario generation,
Main simulator,
Communication simulation functions,
Sensing simulation functions.

## Getting Started
To simulate link-level ISAC, you can run 'scenarioLL' in the scenario folder. To simulate ISAC network, you can run 'scenarioSL' in the same folder.


## Documentation
None at present.
